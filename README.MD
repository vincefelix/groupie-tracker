## Implementation-details-algorithm:
***
```
Our program define structs that helps to store datas from the API after retrieving them by using the get_link function and according to user's request transmits this data to the concerned function (eg: Api_artists, Artists, Api_dates or Api_locations) then send it to the appropriate handler.
```
- **func Api_artists** Get all informations of the API's artist part from "https://groupietrackers.herokuapp.com/api/artists"

- **func api_locations** Gets datas from API's locations part --> "https://groupietrackers.herokuapp.com/api/locations".

+ **func api_dates** Gets datas from API's dates part --> "https://groupietrackers.herokuapp.com/api/dates" .

* **func api_relation** Gets datas from API's dates part --> "https://groupietrackers.herokuapp.com/api/dates" returns relations.

## Testing :
***
```
*** For the unit test file two file are used one that helps to test the API with using the Rest API extension and the other for our programme.

- NB: For unit testing of the API the Rest Client extension must be installed on your PC.
